            Higher level Heroes earn more rewards. Higher levels are increasingly harder to reach, as the amount of $METAL you need to burn to purchase the next level increases. This not only increases
            the battle level of your Heroes, but their desirability too, as it permanently upgrades their on-chain
            metadata.

            To play the game, you need to mint at least one Hero NFT. One Hero can target exactly one
            enemy. On every kill enemies drop rewards, rewards differ based on the strength of the
            enemy. Choose your battles wisely!
